Welcome to the Alfred Dashlane repository: **An Alfred Workflow** ‚ú®

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

* MacOS.
* Alfred 5. Note that the [Alfred Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) is required to use workflows.
* A [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/fr) account.
* Requires **python 3** or above.

## üèéÔ∏è Dashlane CLI

This workflow uses the [Dashlane CLI](https://github.com/Dashlane/dashlane-cli) provided by the [Dashlane team](https://github.com/Dashlane). However, note that the **Dashlane, Inc. does not provide customer support on this project**.

This workflow doesn't hold or register any private data. However, by design it exposes all the Dashlane data to the Alfred app which allows to manipulate it. It's a different approach compare to the offical [1Password integration](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/1password/) from Alfred. If you want to know more on how data is stored on the computer, check this [README](https://github.com/Dashlane/dashlane-cli/blob/master/src/crypto/README.md).

This workflow doesn't allow to update or upload items to the Dashlane vault. You can't connect multiple accounts neither. This is a limitation of the Dashlane CLI for now.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

1. [Download the workflow](https://github.com/BenjaminOddou/alfred-dashlane/releases/latest)
2. Double click the `.alfredworkflow` file to install

## üß∞ Setup the workflow

Install Python 3 or above. Check your version with :

```shell
python --version
```

Install the Dashlane CLI binary using one of the two methods below.

1. Using the following command in your Terminal :

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenjaminOddou/alfred-dashlane/main/install.sh | bash
```

2. Manual installation instructions are available [here](https://github.com/Dashlane/dashlane-cli#how-to-install-manually)

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Invoke the workflow

There is 2 flows in this workflow :

1. The first one allows you to display all the credentials in your dashlane vault. It can be triggered by writing `pdash` keyword.
2. The second one allows you to display your OTPs from you dashlane vault. It can be triggered by writing `odash` keyword.

You can edit these triggers (flagged with a `üïπÔ∏è` symbol) in the user configuration panel.

## ü§ñ Usage of the workflow

### Setup variables

1. `üë§ Login` correspond to your address mail link to your Dashlane account. **It is required to start the workflow**.

2. `ü´• Icognito mode` allows you to hide partially your login (mail address / user name). If `Yes üëç` is selected (by default) :

![incognito_yes](public/incognito_yes.webp)

if `No üëé` is selected :

![incognito_no](public/incognito_no.webp)

1. `üé∑ Notification sound` allows you to personalize the sound of the workflow notification.

### Get your one-time password (OTP) code by mail

> Note that if you have enabled the two steps authetication for your Dashlane account, you can skip this section.

In order to connect to your Dashlane account, you'll need an OTP. If you haven't configure the two steps authentication on your Dashlane account, just hit enter to receive the 6 digits code by mail.

![otp_mail](public/otp_mail.webp)

### Sync your Dashlane account

‚ùó You need an internet connexion to complete this action.

Hit enter, input your master password and finally the OTP (provided via mail or by your 2FA app). If you are already connected you can press enter to refresh the data.

> Note that a sync is already done once per hour by default - see [Dashlane CLI docs](https://github.com/Dashlane/dashlane-cli).

You should have received a `‚úÖ Success !` notification and a mail saying that the connection was successfull.

### Reset local data

If you want to log out and / or remove all local data holds by the Dashlane CLI, hit enter. Confirm your action by inputing `yes` to the alfred search bar.

![confirm_delete](public/confirm_delete.webp)

### Manage passwords and OTPs

#### Password flow

> Use `pdash` keyword to launch this flow.

Search a password by typing its title (custom name or website link to the credentials). Don't forget to include a space between `pdash` and your `{query}`.

![incognito_yes](public/incognito_yes.webp)

1. Press ‚èé to copy the password.
2. Press ‚åò‚èé to copy the login (No Login means that you only register a password for this element).
3. Press ‚å•‚èé to open the url (No URL means that no website is link to this credentials). Alternatively press ‚åòY to preview the url.

**Using Alfred Universal Actions**

Select the element you want to display and run `Universal Actions` with ‚Üí. It shows `Title`, `Login`, `Password` and `Url` link to the element.

![universal_action](public/universal_action.webp)

If you want to know more on how to use Alfred Universal Actions, follow this [link](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/universal-actions/).

#### OTP flow

> Use `odash` keyword to launch this flow.

Search an OTP by typing its title (custom name or website link to the credentials). Don't forget to include a space between `odash` and your `{query}`.

Press ‚èé to copy the OTP. You should see the below notification popping.

![copy_otp_notif](public/copy_otp_notif.webp)

In some edge cases when the title and the login are the same for multiple elements, you'll receive the below warning. Ensure that combination of title and login are unique between elements.

![duplicate](public/duplicate.webp)

### About clipboard

By default, all items that fall in the clipboard (passwords, logins and otps) are transient, meaning they will not fall in the Alfred clipboard history. This is actually wanted as these are sensitive data, but you can change this behavior by unticking the box `Mark item as transient in clipboard` in the `Copy to Clipboard` element in the workflow.
